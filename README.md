Hi, I'm Khulekani !
Data science enthusiast | Problem-solver | Lifelong learner

I'm passionate about turning messy data into meaningful insights. From building predictive models to creating clean, visual storytelling with data, I love using Python, pandas, and machine learning to solve real-world problems.

 I thrive on curiosity, collaboration, and continuous learning.
 Favorite tools: Python, Jupyter, scikit-learn, seaborn, and a good cup of coffee.
 Always open to cool projects, new challenges, and meeting fellow data nerds.

Letâ€™s build something awesome together!
